* Super Rotation System all rotations are reversible, if one is possible, the opposite is also possible. ?????


* Hold

  Hold is a mechanism that allows the player to store the active piece in the hold queue for later use. Only one piece can be in the hold queue. 
  If there is already a piece in the hold queue, and the player holds the active piece, they are swapped, and the piece resets at the top of the playfield,
  becoming the new active piece. Hold cannot be used again until the piece locks down. Some games don't have the required space to display a hold piece, 
  or that lack the necessary amount of buttons, may skip this mechanic. The combination of hold piece and Random Generator allows the player to play forever.
